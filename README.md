# NUMBER-CHECKER-
I created a Number Checker program to determine if a number is odd or even. I used if check_number % 2 == 0: to check for even numbers and added a condition for odd numbers. Error handling with except ValueError: ensures valid input. After testing, I confirmed the program works perfectly. 


This is the video of making a number checker.
