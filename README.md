# NUMBER-CHECKER-
I created a Number Checker program to determine whether a number is odd or even. I used if check_number % 2 == 0: to check for even numbers and added a condition for odd numbers. This function utilizes an if-elif-else structure, helping students practice mathematical operations, conditional logic, and function calls in Python. After testing, I confirmed that the program works perfectly."



This is the video of making a number checker.
